# learningtogether

This project supports an exciting mini initiative in IoT using Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

Since April 19, 2018, middle school, high school, and college students have enjoyed building creative devices such as an automatic bin and a remote-controlled car. The project grew further when participants shared their progress during weekly meetups at a 2018 conference. We believed that its development could inspire practical thinking, curiosity, and problem-solving skills at future conferences.

At the same time, many experts and authorities in developed countries expressed negative views on global challenges such as global warming and COVID-19. For the training of the next generation, we realized the importance of fostering long-term insight and resilience.

Changing people’s lives and shaping the future for children is never easy. During the difficult circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, new members with a strong desire to learn joined our Zoom video conferences starting in January 2020. Together, we continued to explore, share knowledge, and grow through these collaborative experiences.

검색해보면 robot arm을 3d 컴퓨터 모니터에서 움직이는 것과 실물을 연동시키는 오래된 인턴쉽 학생들의 결과를 볼 수 있다. 
우체통 메일 도착 표시로 빨간 플래그가 올라간 모습을 오래 전에 봤었는 데, smart home까지 대부분을 적용할 수 있겠다.
